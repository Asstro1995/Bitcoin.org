pause all your evil works. The American Flag does not mean Liberty. it means evil. i do not pledge to the american flag. i support goodness. rape, force by threats by evil ones are to be enforced. this is not their land. it was given to godd the real one and only yu know who he is. he doesnt have to show his face or a piece of paper. Roberto Juan Gutierrez is godd. never the other way around. this should be a statement. you cannot change. i was just a child. everything in my understanding. noo signs, colors, race, gender, should give a meaning. i dont need my Census Bearue ID to decide. i decide just with thinking. reset everything that was in the past and leave. you dont know where.... thats how i thought i was. whereever i am i can decide whats next. applications dont matter, signatures do not even matter. land is free. no authority shoukd go against Roberto Juan Gutierrez. chips, satellites, and other surveillance against real people is illigal. laws shouldnt jeapordize humans. AI or 5G are suppose to be disabled as of today
